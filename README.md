### Chrome Web Store (Lite version)
The published extension lacks the ability to track the number of requests and notify you, but you can still use it for blocking requests. The reason is that the extension uses the `declarativeNetRequest.onRuleMatchedDebug` API which is not available for publishing in the Chrome Web Store.
Get it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/little-rat/oiopkpalpilladnibecobcecijffaflf)
